Ukraine deployed three battalions reinforced with tanks, said Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s chief spokesman, but he added that the attack and a second one near Robotyne, a Russian-held frontline village around eight miles southeast of Orikhiv, had been repelled.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mr. Konashenkov\u2019s comments, reported by the Russian state news agency Tass, could not be independently confirmed, and Ukrainian officials did not directly comment. But the area south of Orikhiv, a town that Ukraine holds, is a key battleground in its push to expel Russian forces from the south and east of the country, and both sides have built up their forces in the area. Vladimir Rogov, an official appointed by Moscow in southern Ukraine, said on the Telegram app that fierce battles had begun south of Orikhiv, involving Ukrainian troops who had been trained abroad and were equipped with about 100 German-made Leopard tanks and American-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Russian occupation official said Ukrainian forces equipped with Western weapons had begun a significant attack in the Zaporizhzhia region.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Here\u2019s what we\u2019re covering:<\/strong><br \/>\nThe area south of Orikhiv is a key battleground in Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive.<br \/>\nBritish military intelligence says Russia plans to enforce a blockade against Ukraine.<br \/>\nThe U.N.

He said that Moscow\u2019s forces had rebuffed Ukrainian attempts to break through Russian defenses. The Ukrainian military\u2019s general staff said in its daily update on Wednesday that Russian forces were engaged in defensive operations in the Zaporizhzhia region. A spokesman for the general staff, Andriy Kovalev, said that Russian forces had unsuccessfully tried to restore lost positions northeast of Robotyne. \u201cThe enemy continues to put up strong resistance, moves units, and actively uses reserves,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that he had met with Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, and discussed offensive and defensive fighting on the front line. \u201cWe believe in our boys,\u201d Mr. Zelensky said on Telegram, giving no details of military operations. \u201cWe continue to work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive, launched last month and conducted along three axes including in the western part of Zaporizhzhia region, has moved more slowly than some military experts and Western allies had expected. In part, this is because of dense Russian minefields, which have impeded Ukraine\u2019s advances, but also because of the strong resistance of Russian forces who have had months to prepare.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, Ukraine had not yet sent into battle many of its Western-trained troops or the latest vehicles supplied by allies, according to U.S. officials. Ukraine\u2019s overall objective on the southern front is to reach the Sea of Azov, which is about 60 miles south of Orikhiv. Doing so would cut off the so-called land bridge connecting Russian occupation forces in southern Ukraine from those in the east.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ukrainian forces launched a \u201cmassive\u201d attack south of the town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday, suggesting that a new phase of Kyiv\u2019s southern counteroffensive may be underway.
